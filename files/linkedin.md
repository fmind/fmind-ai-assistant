## About

When I worked as a teacher, I told my students that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the most effective levers to make a difference. Every day, new AI and ML solutions are released to empower companies and individuals alike. The question is: Is your business ready to provide the best AI/ML products for your customers?

I'm a professional Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, and MLOps ready to assist you in this quest. I've completed a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and several high-end AI/ML certifications to help you build leading data-driven services. My past experiences include working with companies like Google, BNP Paribas, ArcelorMittal, the European Commission, and Decathlon to frame their needs, create state-of-the-art models and deliver AI/ML artifacts at scale.

I now work as a freelancer in Luxembourg, and I can carry out missions remotely in other European countries. You can get in touch with me on LinkedIn or at contact@fmind.dev. I'll be happy to collaborate with you or discuss your favored AI/ML topics in the MLOps Community.

MLOps projects are straightforward to initiate, but challenging to perfect. While AI/ML projects often start with a notebook for prototyping, deploying them directly in production is often considered poor practice by the MLOps community. Transitioning to a dedicated Python code base is essential for industrializing the project, yet this move presents several challenges: 1) How can we maintain a code base that is robust yet flexible for agile development? 2) Is it feasible to implement proven design patterns while keeping the code base accessible to all developers? 3) How can we leverage Python’s dynamic nature while adopting strong typing practices akin to static languages?

Throughout my career, I have thoroughly explored various strategies to make my code base both simple and powerful. In 2009, I had the opportunity to collaborate with seasoned developers and enthusiasts of design patterns in object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java. By 2015, I had devoted hundreds of hours to mastering functional programming paradigms with languages like Clojure (LISP) and Haskell. This journey led me to discover both modern and time-tested practices, which I have applied to my AI/ML projects. I am eager to share these practices and reveal the most effective solutions I’ve encountered.

In this article, I propose a method to develop high-quality MLOps projects using Python's ABC and Pydantic. I begin by emphasizing the importance of implementing SOLID software practices in AI/ML codebases. Next, I offer some background on design patterns and the SOLID principles. Then, I recount my experiences with various code architectures and their limitations. Finally, I explain how Python's ABC and Pydantic can enhance the quality of your Python code and facilitate the adoption of sound coding practices.

Large Language Model (LLM) is such an existing topic. Since the release of ChatGPT, we saw a surge of innovation ranging from education mentorship to finance advisory. Each week is a new opportunity for addressing new kinds of problems, increasing human productivity, or improving existing solutions. Yet, we may wonder if this is just a new hype cycle or if organizations are truly adopting LLMs at scale …

On March 2023, the MLOps Community issued a survey about LLMs in production to picture the state of adoption. The survey is full of interesting insights, but there is a catch: 80% of the questions are open-ended, which means respondents answered the survey freely from a few keywords to full sentences. I volunteered to clean up the answers with the help of ChatGPT and let the community get a grasp of the survey experiences.

In this article, I present the steps and lessons learned from my journey to shed some light on the MLOps survey on LLMs. I’m first going to present the goal and questions of the survey. Then, I will explain how I used ChatGPT to review the data and standardize the content. Finally, I’m going to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT compared to a manual review.

## Creating better ground truth to further understand Android malware: A large scale mining approach based on antivirus labels and malicious artifacts

- Publisher: University of Luxembourg
- Publication date: July 1, 2019

Mobile applications are essential for interacting with technology and other people. With more than 2 billion devices deployed all over the world, Android offers a thriving ecosystem by making accessible the work of thousands of developers on digital marketplaces such as Google Play. Nevertheless, the success of Android also exposes millions of users to malware authors who seek to siphon private information and hijack mobile devices for their benefits.

To fight against the proliferation of Android malware, the security community embraced machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that powers a new generation of detection systems.  Machine learning algorithms, however, require a substantial number of qualified samples to learn the classification rules enforced by security experts. Unfortunately, malware ground truths are notoriously hard to construct due to the inherent complexity of Android applications and the global lack of public information about malware. In a context where both information and human resources are limited, the security community is in demand for new approaches to aid practitioners to accurately define Android malware, automate classification decisions, and improve the comprehension of Android malware.

This dissertation proposes three solutions to assist with the creation of malware ground truths.

## Euphony: Harmonious Unification of Cacophonous Anti-Virus Vendor Labels for Android Malware

- Publisher: MSR 2017
- Publication date: May 21, 2017

Android malware is now pervasive and evolving rapidly. Thousands of malware samples are discovered every day with new models of attacks.  The growth of these threats has come hand in hand with the proliferation of collective repositories sharing the latest specimens. Having access to a large number of samples opens new research directions aiming at efficiently vetting apps. However, automatically inferring a reference ground-truth from those repositories is not straightforward and can inadvertently lead to unforeseen misconceptions. On the one hand, samples are often mislabeled as different parties use distinct naming schemes for the same sample. On the other hand, samples are frequently misclassified due to conceptual errors made during labeling processes.

In this paper, we analyze the associations between all labels given by different vendors and we propose a system called EUPHONY to systematically unify common samples into family groups. The key novelty of our approach is that no prior knowledge of malware families is needed. We evaluate our approach using reference datasets and more than 0.4 million additional samples outside of these datasets. Results show that EUPHONY provides competitive performance against the state-of-the-art.

## On the Lack of Consensus in Anti-Virus Decisions: Metrics and Insights on Building Ground Truths of Android Malware

- Publisher: DIMVA 2016

There is generally a lack of consensus in Antivirus (AV) engines' decisions on a given sample. This challenges the building of authoritative ground-truth datasets. Instead, researchers and practitioners may rely on unvalidated approaches to build their ground truth, e.g., by considering decisions from a selected set of Antivirus vendors or by setting up a threshold number of positive detections before classifying a sample. Both approaches are biased as they implicitly either decide on ranking AV products, or they consider that all AV decisions have equal weights. In this paper, we extensively investigate the lack of agreement among AV engines.

To that end, we propose a set of metrics that quantitatively describe the different dimensions of this lack of consensus. We show how our metrics can bring important insights by using the detection results of 66 AV products on 2 million Android apps as a case study.  Our analysis focuses not only on AV binary decision but also on the notoriously hard problem of labels that AVs associate with suspicious files, and allows to highlight biases hidden in the collection of a malware ground truth---a foundation stone of any machine learning-based malware detection approach.
